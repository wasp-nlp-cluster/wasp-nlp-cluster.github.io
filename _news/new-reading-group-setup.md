After thinking about how our reading group was set up in the past, we have decided to try a new way for our meetings. We believe this change will help more people join and also make it easier to keep track of the knowledge shared in our discussions. We considered using [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/wasp-nlp-cluster/discussions) for a few reasons. First, it gives a private and simple way for our members to share. Second, it allows us to grow if more people join. Also, it means that members do not have to share their Google Accounts, as some people might use other services. Lastly, we want to find a solution for how to manage if someone wants to take the lead in future meetings.

I will now explain how we can use this feature. We will introduce “the curator,” who will take charge of leading the reading group session. The curator’s role should be rotated among all members. You can select a paper that you think is interesting to share with other NLP-related members, or you can start a poll and let members vote for the paper they find most exciting, or you can suggest your own options. After that, you need to run another poll to decide the best date and time for the session that suits most members. Please remember to schedule the session at least seven days after the paper has been decided on. As a curator, you should use Slack to announce the event and begin the discussion on GitHub. Sadly, we used to have a mailing list that made things easier in the past.

Please follow these instructions when starting a discussion under the “[Reading Group](https://github.com/orgs/wasp-nlp-cluster/discussions/categories/reading-group)” section:

- Use the paper’s title as the discussion’s title.
- Write a summary of the paper in the discussion body.
- Members are invited to contribute, ask questions, share challenges or concerns, and discuss possible future research opportunities.
- Use the following format when posting:)
  - For questions: `[questions] Write your prompt here.`
  - For challenges/concerns: `[challenges] Write your prompt here.`
  - For future research opportunities: `[opportunities] Write your prompt here.`
