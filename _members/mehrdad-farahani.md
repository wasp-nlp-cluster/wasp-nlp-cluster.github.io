    Hi There ðŸ‘‹ , I'm Mehrdad Farahani


    I am currently in my third year of a PhD program at Chalmers University of Technology, which I began in 2022 under the supervision of Richard Johansson (CTH) and Gabriel Skantze (KTH). My current research focuses on the controllability and interpretability of language models. For nearly a year, I have been working in this area.


    As part of my goal to advance research in Conversational AI, I have decided to work on small pieces of this large puzzle. Specifically, I aim to understand how current language models used in conversational AI applications can perceive and comprehend the broader aspects of this complex field by focusing more on language models' controllability and interpretability.
